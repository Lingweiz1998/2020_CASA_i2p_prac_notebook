This means that whereas for lists we use integers as indexes to access elements, in dictonaries we use 'keys' (which can multiple different types; strings, integers, etc.).

    "If you stop to think about it, then our list-of-lists approach to the Airbnb data isn't very easy to navigate. Notice that if the location of the description or name column changes between different versions of the file (as it did... deliberately), then we need to change our program _every_ time we re-run it! Also remember that we in order to work out the answer to a simple question such 'what is the average cost of an Airbnb venue' the we need to step through a lot of irrelevant data as well: we have to write a `for` loop and then step through each row with an 'accumulator' (somewhere to store the total). So it's error-prone and it's slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't make much sense since this should all be _easier_ and _faster_ in Python than in Excel, but right now it's _harder_, and quite possibly _slower_ as well! When you get into situations like this (having to write a lot of code to do something that should be fast and easy) it is often the case that you've got the wrong _data structure_. So how does the experienced programmer get around this? 'Simple' (i.e. neither simple, nor obvious, until you know the answer): she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We humans tend to think in rows of data: this apartment has the following _attributes_ (price, location, etc.), and that the shared room has a different set of attributes. Se we read across the row because that's the easiest way for us to think about it. But, in short, a list-of-lists does _not_ seem to be the right way to store this data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, a computer doesn't have to work that way. For a computer, it's as easy to read _down_ a column as it is to read _across_ a row. In fact, it's easier, because each column has the same _type_ of data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains prices (integers), and other columns contain other types of data (floats, etc.). Better still, the order of the columns often doesn't matter as long as we know what they are called: it's easier to ask for the 'description column' than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the description column might be in a different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely to use the 'description' label for the column itself.\n",

With our CSV files above we already saw what a pain it was to fix things when the layout of the columns changed from one data set to the next. If, instead, we can just reference the 'description' column then it doesn't matter where that column actually is. Why is that? \n",

It finds out that the value associated with this key is a _list_ (`[9787426, 2553379, 2440986]`). In this example, it just pulls out the first value (index 1), which is `2553379`.

Notice the complete _absence_ of a for loop?\n",

If it does then you should be having a kind of an Mind-Blown moment because what we've done by taking a column view, rather than a row view is to make Python's ``index()`` command do the work for us. Instead of having to look through each row for a field that matches 'Name' and then check to see if it's 'Manchester', we've pointed Python at the right column immediately and asked it to find the match (which it can do very quickly). Once we have a match then we _also_ have the row number to go and do the lookup in the 'Population' column because the index _is_ the row number!"

To figure out the easternmost city in this list we need to find the _maximum_ Longitude and then use _that_ value to look up the city name. So let's do the same process of pulling this apart into two steps. Let start with the easier bit:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "That would give us the name of a city, but we don't just want the first city in the list, we want the one with the maximum longitude. To achieve _that_ we need to somehow replace the `0` with the _**index of the maximum longitude**_. Let's break this down further: \n",
    "1. We first need to _find_ the maximum longitude.\n",
    "2. We then need to _find_ the **index** of that maximum longitude.\n",

    "So Step 1 would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "max_lon = max(myData['Longitude'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because the `max(...)` helps us to find the maximum longitude in the Longitude list. Now that we have that we can proceed to Step 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myData['Longitude'].index(max_lon)\n",
    "```\n",
    "So now we ask Python to find the position of `max_lon` in the list. But rather than doing this in two steps we can combine into one if we write it down to make it easier to read:\n",

    "myData['Longitude'].index(\n",
    "    max(myData['Longitude'])\n",

All we've done is change what's _inside_ that index function to `max(myData['Longitude'])`. This is telling Python to find the _maximum_ value in the `myData['Longitude']` list. So to explain this in three steps, what we're doing is:\n",

That's a handy way to make your code a little easier to read. If you're creating a list and it's getting a little long, then you can also continue a line using a `,` as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first f-string\n",
    "The first string will help you to make sense of the second: f-strings allow you to 'interpolate' a variable into a string directly rather than having to have lots of `str(x) + \" some text \" + str(y)`. You can write `f\"{x} some text {y}\"` and Python will automatically convert the variables `x` and `y` to strings and replace `{x}` with the _value of `x`_ and `{y}` with the _value of `y`_. \n",

    "2. The second f-string\n",
    "This one is hard because there's just a _lot_ of code there. But, again, if we start with what we recognise that it gets just a little bit more manageable... Also, it stands to reason that the only difference between the two outputs is that one asks for the 'Longitude' and the other for the 'Latitude'. So if you can make sense of one you have _automatically_ made sense of the other and don't need to work it all out.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'].index(city)\n",

    "```python \n",
    "myData['Longitude'][5]\n",
