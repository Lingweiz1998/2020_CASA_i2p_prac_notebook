The easiest way to do this is work from your `Documents` folder and set up some directories there to hold your code and data. You should generally go with what makes sense to you, but leaving everything in the Downloads folder or in random places all over you computer is likely to be a disaster.\n",

    "mkdir CASA/modules # make a directory called `modules` under `CASA`\n",
    "mkdir CASA/modules/i2p # make an intro to programming directory\n",
    "```\n",
